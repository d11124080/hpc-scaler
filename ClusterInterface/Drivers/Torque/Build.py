'''
Build object for pbs_python package source used as part of the TorqueDriver.
The pbs_python library needs to be compiled against the running version of Torque, so
binary distribution could not be used. Object should be used where an ImportError exception
is thrown by the ClusterInterface when trying to import from the pbs wrapper library.
