This driver depends on several components in order to function correctly:

pbs_python is a python module containing wrappers for the Torque C library. It should be installed relative to the hpc-scaler
installation as follows: {hpc-scalar-home}/ClusterInterface/Drivers/Torque/pbs_python/<version> where version is the alphabetic
spelling of the version number, unspaced. (i.e 4.3.5 becomes "fourthreefive").
