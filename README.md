A Dynamic HPC Cluster Scaling Engine

The Dynamic Cluster Scaling Engine (DCSE) is a software project to scale High Performance Compute (HPC) Clusters, increasing or decreasing the size of a cluster by managing the availability of “worker” nodes (the physical or virtual servers to which cluster jobs are farmed out for processing) according to real-time demand.
The DCSE allows HPC stakeholders to reduce both the initial capital investment required to build a HPC cluster and the considerable running costs in terms of energy required to run such systems.
Initial investment costs can be reduced by the DCSE via “cloudbursting” (expanding the cluster by adding virtualised worker node instances in public “cloud” resources) at times of peak demand, reducing the number of physical worker nodes required at the procurement stage.
Running costs can be lowered by the DCSE by powering on and off cluster worker nodes dynamically according to demand.
